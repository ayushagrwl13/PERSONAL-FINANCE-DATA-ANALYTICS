# PERSONAL-FINANCE-DATA-ANALYTICS

In this project, I build a Personal Finance Dashboard in POWERBI which is useful to anyone who wants to track personal expenses, income and financial goals.
I took my own monthly expenses, savings and income to build this project and using python libraries and POWER BI, I analyze 

What is my net worth ?
Is my spending pattern right ?
Am I reaching my savings target ?
Which months are financially bad/good ?
Where/How do I spend ?
Where/How do I save ?

This project helps me in financial literacy at very early age and if anyone follow this project in his or her life, it will help in building financial literacy and wealth.
